Introduction
============

I always wanted to get some insights on public transport and as I am very programming affine I started investigating into the VVS API.
However, I noticed really fast that the EFA system is not really programmer-friendly, at least if you are still getting into it.

I saw some projects from CodeOfGermany and various others, but as they are way out to date, I figured that I want to publish my own solution.

For example I am using this library to track my daily used connections and sending push notifications on my mobile device if one is delayed.

But there are various other things you can done. For example a simple dashboard that displays upcoming departures at a nearby station.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: python

    pip install vvspy
